                <h4>Assessment:</h4>
                <p>The first step is to assess the extent of the hail damage on the vehicle. Our skilled technicians carefully inspect each dent to determine the best approach for repair.</p>

            </div>

            <div className="col-md-4">
              <div className="row">
                <h4>Access:</h4>
                <p>To access the dented area, the technician removes interior panels, weather stripping, or other components. This is necessary to reach the backside of the dent.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div className="col-md-4">
              <div className="row">
                <h4>Tools and Technique:</h4>
                <p>Specialized tools, including metal rods and hand-operated hammers, are used to gently massage the dent from the inside, pushing it back into its original shape. The technician's expertise and precision are crucial at this stage to avoid damaging the paint.</p>            
              </div>

            <div className="col-md-4">
              <div className="row">
                <h4>Finishing Touch:</h4>
                <p>Once the dent is restored, any imperfections or high spots are carefully smoothed out to ensure a seamless finish.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div className="col-md-4">
              <div className="row">
                <h4>Quality Inspection:</h4>
                <p>After the repair is completed, a thorough quality inspection is performed to ensure that the dents are completely removed, leaving no visible signs of damage.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div className="col-md-4">
              <div className="row">
                <h4>Paint Protection:</h4>
                <p>Because Paintless Dent Repair does not require repainting, the original paint finish is preserved, maintaining the vehicle's value and appearance.</p>
